\section*{Work Experience}

\textbf{Credit Saison} \
\textit{Software Engineer TL - DevOps} \hfill May 2023 – Present
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed end-to-end AWS infrastructure for the Loan Management System using CloudFormation, provisioning EC2, Load Balancers, Target Groups, listener rules, Route53 DNS records, and RDS with IaC best practices.
    \item Re-architected LMS to scale under increasing loan volumes by decoupling UI and API workloads across independent compute layers, eliminating crossndependency downtime during feature deployments.
    \item Resolved cloud misconfigurations, enforced IaC scanning, and supported Kubernetes security controls in alignment with RBI MD-ITF, SOC 2, ISO 27001, CIS Benchmarks and RBI UCB compliance standards using SentinalOne tool.
    \item Implemented horizontal scaling via Auto Scaling Groups and scheduled vertical scaling (CPU/RAM) only during EOD batch workloads using Lambda automation, significantly reducing EC2 consumption throughout the day.
    \item Automated repetitive operations such as DB maintenance, log delivery, and housekeeping using shell scripts, cron jobs, and AWS Systems Manager, reducing manual labor and operational noise.
    \item Contributed to a major loan migration (100K+ loans) by architecting supporting infrastructure and assisting database teams with import, validation, and consistency checks.
    \item Provisioned lower environments using parameterized IaC to mirror production architecture with cost optimized resources, enabling reliable regression testing before LMS releases.
    \item Maintained production EKS clusters using PDBs, autoscaling, and rolling/surge deployments to ensure zero downtime; upgraded versions from 1.29 to 1.33.
    \item Developed a Jira driven automation workflow to provision SFTP users on AWS Transfer Family using Node.js, automatically creating IAM roles, policies, public/private key pairs, and delivering credentials to requesters via SES integration.
    \item Ubuntu 24.04 hardened by implementing handbook security controls via Ansible, created a compliant base image using Image Builder, and deployed 50+ microservices on the hardened OS.
    \item Participated in the cost optimization initiative and delivered a 9\% reduction in overall AWS spend within a sprint by reviewing multiple environments, and strategized resource tagging coverage to enable departmental cost visibility.
    \item Operated as DBA for 15+ RDS PostgreSQL databases across prod and non-prod, writing targeted SQL scripts to triage incidents, unblock development, and support data dumps/restorations.
    \item Led and mentored a 20+ member 24×7 external monitoring team; conducted KT sessions on AWS console usage, Datadog dashboards, and Jira workflows; authored SOPs and operational runbooks in Confluence.
    \item Documented end-to-end processes, escalation flows, and environment standards to build repeatable institutional knowledge on Confluence.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Amazon} \\
\textit{Cloud Operations Associate (App Services)} \hfill Apr 2021 – May 2023
\begin{itemize}
    \item Supported Amazon Appstore’s developer ecosystem for US/UK/IN regions, resolving infrastructure-level issues for hosted apps.
    \item Used AWS Console extensively for environment validation, log tracing, EC2/CloudWatch metrics, and S3 operations.
    \item Developed lightweight automation scripts in Python and Shell to streamline data delivery, deployment status checks, and report generation.
    \item Maintained MySQL databases used for tracking developer submissions, app metrics, and deployment records.
    \item Collaborated with policy, QA, and engineering teams to maintain high platform availability and ensure compliance across 10+ device platforms.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Micro Focus} \\
\textit{Cloud Support Engineer – Infrastructure Monitoring} \hfill May 2020 – Apr 2021
\begin{itemize}
    \item Provided hybrid cloud observability support using OBM, SiteScope, and SMAX integrated with AWS environments.
    \item Supported enterprises in monitoring EC2, on-prem Linux, and Windows servers; automated alert checks and logs collection via Python and Shell.
    \item Created internal scripts for status verification and reporting, improving incident response time and reducing MTTR.
    \item Authored standard operating procedures for onboarding, monitoring setup, and escalation workflows.
\end{itemize}
